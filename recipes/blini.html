    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat together milk and eggs in a large bowl until combined. 
            Beat in sugar and salt. Mix in baking soda and citric acid until incorporated. 
            Blend in flour, a little at a time, until combined. Beat in oil. 
            Pour in boiling water, stirring constantly, until batter is thin and watery. 
            Let rest for about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a small frying pan over medium-high heat. 
            Pick the pan up off the heat. 
            Pour in a ladleful of batter while you rotate your wrist, tilting the pan, so batter forms a circle and coats the bottom.
            The blini should be very thin.</li>
        <li>Return the pan to the heat. 
            Cook blini for 90 seconds. 
            Carefully lift up edge of blini to see if it's fully cooked: edges will be golden and bottom surface should have brown spots. 
            Flip blini over and cook for 1 minute more.</li>
        <li>Transfer blini to a plate lined with a clean kitchen towel. 
            Continue cooking remaining batter, adding 1 tablespoon butter to the pan for every 4 blinis. 
            Stack blinis and cover with another kitchen towel to keep warm.</li>
        <li>Spread desired filling in the center of each blini. 
            Fold 3 times to make a triangle shape or fold up all 4 sides, like a small burrito.
        </li>
